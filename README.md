# Overview

ERC-404 merges the features of ERC-20 (fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens), offering a unique approach to tokenization in the blockchain ecosystem. The standard enables tokens to represent both fungible and non-fungible assets depending on their state.

# Benefits

- Enhanced Liquidity: By combining the features of fungible and non-fungible tokens, ERC-404 enhances liquidity by allowing assets to be traded in fractionalized forms.

- Composability: ERC-404 opens up new possibilities for composability within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space and other blockchain applications by providing a seamless integration of fungible and non-fungible assets.
